# Stonker

Stonker is a Telegram bot that helps you track stock investments, notifying you when stock prices change. No more constantly checking pricesâ€”Stonker has you covered.

> **DISCLAIMER:** Invest at your own risk, even with Stonker at your service. I take no responsibility for any financial outcomes.

---

## Setting up and running

### 1. Requirements

- Node.js **18+** (Older versions may work but are untested.)

### 2. Get Your Token

You need a Telegram bot token. Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to obtain one.

### 3. Running the Bot

#### Option 1: Without Docker

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pgvalle/Stonker
cd Stonker
npm install
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='your_token_here'
node src/main.js
```

#### Option 2: Without Docker

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pgvalle/Stonker
cd Stonker
docker build -t stonker .
docker run -e TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='your_token_here' -d stonker
```

## Usage

The bot supports the following commands:

- **/invest STOCK VALUE DIFF**
  - Simulates stock investment.
  - `VALUE` must be >= 1.00.
  - `DIFF` must be > 0.00 (notification each time VALUE changes by DIFF).
  - Reinvesting on the same stock overwrites the previous investment.
  - Only 2 decimals are used (e.g. 0.001 -> $0.00).
  - Example:
    ```
    /invest AMD 1 0.01
    /invest AMD 1.00 1  # Overwrites previous investment
    ```

- **/linvest [STOCK ...]**
  - Lists your investments in specified stocks.
  - If no arguments are provided, lists all investments.
  - Example:
    ```
    /linvest
    /linvest AMD TSLA NVDA
    ```

- **/dinvest [STOCK ...]**
  - Deletes your investments in specified stocks.
  - If no arguments are provided, deletes all investments.
  - Example:
    ```
    /dinvest
    /dinvest AMD TSLA NVDA
    ```

- **/stock [STOCK ...]**
  - Lists specified stocks and their last known prices.
  - If no arguments are provided, lists all tracked stocks.
  - The bot just knows stocks that users have invested with /invest.
  - Example:
    ```
    /stock
    /stock AMD TSLA NVDA
    ```

- **/help [COMMAND ...]**
  - Shows help for specified commands.
  - If no arguments are provided, lists all commands.
  - Example:
    ```
    /help
    /help invest stock
    ```

## Motivation

A realization hit me after playing a little bit with the stocks market and talking to friends: Either you are extremely lucky, have privileged information or can monitor stock price changes every second. But I bet you are none of those, just like me. So here is Stonker to help you.

## The Journey

I was not familiar with stocks at all. That influenced all the development process, specially when I was looking for a way to collect real-time stock data. Initially, I thought [gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2](https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2) was going to help me, but it turned out not to be what i needed. After 2 days trying to make sense out of it, I found [gregtuc/StockSocket](https://github.com/gregtuc/StockSocket), which was exactly what I needed.

Another challenge was structuring the code. I started with everything in a single file, but after nearly a week, I finally managed to reorganize it. I struggled with design patterns and got frustrated at times, especially due to my tendency to strive for symmetry and perfection, which lead to me hanging for hours just trying to make my code "look good".

## Technology Stack

- **SQLite3** - I wanted a lightweight database, so SQLite fit well for this project.
- **NodeJS** - Although I'm not a big fan of javascript, it's widely used, and I wanted to improve my portfolio.
- **[yagop/node-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api)** - Initially, I considered WhatsApp but found both its official and unofficial APIs bad fits for this project (You need to create a meta developer account or to have a spare phone number). Telegram turned out to be a really good option.
- **[gregtuc/StockSocket](https://github.com/gregtuc/StockSocket)** - Provides real-time stock data updates via websockets. It's archived, but it works.
